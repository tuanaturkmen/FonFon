# FonFon
FonFon is a unified, data-driven web-based analytics system that solves the problem of fragmented and unclear mutual fund information. It helps individual investors and financial professionals make investment decisions by giving them clear access to what-if scenarios, fund performance, market trends, and comparison tools.

It fills the gap between existing bank-specific platforms and the need for a single, objective, and easy-to-use financial decision support tool.
